            My go to when it comes to developing on the go. I love bringing this
            to the local cafe, listening to music, and coding
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Custom built PC">
            When I am not at a cafe, I will use my desktop computer. I have a
            custom built PC with 32gb of RAM, ASUS TUF 3080, Ryzen 5800, all
            sitting pretty in a Lian Li O11 Dyanamic. I love building computers
            and personalizing them. I even have a nice little Gengar GPU
            backplate!

          <Tool title="Sublime Text 4">
            I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features everyone
            else relies on, Sublime Text is still the best text editor ever
            made.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="iTerm2">
            I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that aren’t
            just part of the macOS Terminal but it’s what I use.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="TablePlus">
            Great software for working with databases. Has saved me from
            building about a thousand admin interfaces for my various projects
            over the years.
          </Tool>

        <ToolsSection title="Design">
          <Tool title="Figma">
            We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become our
            virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have expected
            the collaboration features to be the real hook.
          </Tool>

        <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
          <Tool title="Alfred">
            It’s not the newest kid on the block but it’s still the fastest. The
            Sublime Text of the application launcher world.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Reflect">
            Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
            organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with
            Reflect, it’s still easy for me to keep all of that stuff
            discoverable by topic even though all of my writing happens in the
            daily note.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="SavvyCal">
            Great tool for scheduling meetings while protecting my calendar and
            making sure I still have lots of time for deep work during the week.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Focus">
            Simple tool for blocking distracting websites when I need to just do
            the work and get some momentum going.
          </Tool>
